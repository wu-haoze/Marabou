* Development plan

** Development loop 
*** Milestone evaluation
- Evaluating correctness AND performance
*** Iteration evaluation
- Focus on correctness
**** Think of invariants, document them
**** Write unit tests
**** Reviews (A* and Guy) 
***** A^3: Paired development, third A is local reviewer (@Stanford)
**** Small modular self-contained PRs
**** Small test cases (regression)
- Think of tests ahead of the code
**** Quick, but quality development 
**** Comment the code: 
***** How does it work
***** What are the assumptions and assurances
***** How is intended to be changed, if part of multiple iterations 
***** The code should be as readable as possible, use descriptive names
** Continuous changes:
*** Simple refactors - more appropriate names
*** Introducing namespaces 
*** Switch to more compact logging/error traces 
** Philosophy: 
*** Implement changes by shadowing existing features
- Expectation: New implementation is in lockstep with the old feature
*** Debug by checking equivalence between the new and old feature 
- Expectation: The two systems behave equivalently
*** Transition to new feature 
- Check performance (if it makes sense)
** M1 - Introducing incremental and modular problem representation
*** Refactor SMTCore 
**** 1a Add Context 
***** Start using namespaces (look at the proposal of logical decomposition)
****** Retain CVC4::Context namespace
****** Introduce Marabou namespace
***** Add and compile Context and dependent CVC4 code
- Expectation: Context* classes and any dependencies compile without any errors/warnings
- Dependencies include CVC4 macros for logging and tracing, which are more compact than in Marabou
****** DONE Include Context classes in the Marabou::Context namespace
CLOSED: [2020-03-24 Tue 13:53]
- Included in CVC4 namespace
****** DONE Include logging macros in Marabou::Utils namespace (Pros/Cons?)
CLOSED: [2020-03-24 Tue 13:53]
- Included in CVC4 namespace
****** DONE Remove -wError for CVC4 dependencies
CLOSED: [2020-03-30 Mon 14:12]
***** DONE Add _context, an instance of Context class, as a member of SMTCore
CLOSED: [2020-03-30 Mon 15:45]
- Expectation: _context decision level is in sync with the depth of existing search procedure
- Depth = number of ReLU splits asserted by the SMTCore
****** Add new context frame whenever a new ReLU split is performed.
- Inv: New context frame is created whenever we split
- Test: With empty stack, make a decision, expect one frame in the _context  
- This occurs in two places:
- when splitting a ReLU for the first time
- when backtracking a ReLU and an alternative PWLCaseSplit is applied.
****** Remove a context frame whenever a popSplit() is called.
- Inv: Context frame is popped whenever we backtrack
- Test: Start with one element on stack, pop decision, expect and empty _context s
****** Both:
- Inv: Context decision level is in sync with depth of the existing search  
**** 2a Add Trail (of PiecewiseLinearCaseSplits)
***** Add _trail, of type CDList<PiecewiseLinearCaseSplit>, to SMTCore
- Expectation: _trail is associated with _context
- Long-term goal, move to CDList<Literals>?
****** Alternative splits:
- Asked from PWLConstraint at the time of decisions/implications 
- Based on the last popped PWLConstraint
- Instead of storing all alternative splits, we can only store the last decision.
- Idea: Encapsulate context.pop to return last decision (that is being popped)
****** Tests:
******* Push/Pop functionality
******* Sync pushed splitCases with existing search 
******* Sync popped splitCases with existing search
***** Push ReLU splits to _trail 
- Expectation: _trail contains all the currently active PWLCaseSplits in the search
- Expectation: splitting asserts a PWLCaseSplit on a new decision level
- Expectation: implication asserts a PWLCaseSplit on the same decision level
- PWLCaseSplits are asserted in two ways:
- by splitting (in SmtCore::performSplit())
- by implication (i.e. bound propagation)
- NOTE: The decision/implication distinction should come for free, by correctly
  positioning the call to _context.push()
***** Pop ReLU splits from the _trail
- Expectation: _trail contains all the currently active PWLCaseSplits in the search
**** 3a Refactor performSplit
- Expectation: can perform a split on a particular case of a ReLU
- Expectation: logic of which case to split on and splitting are separated
***** Refactor into two methods:
****** chooseSplitCase()
- Expectation: Implements logic of which case should be asserted next
****** performSplit(PWLCaseSplit case)
- Expectation: the *PWLCaseSplit case* to be asserted is passed as an argument
***** @5a: Eliminate state storing 
**** 4a Refactor popSplit()
- Expectation: popSplit() only pops a PWLCaseSplit
- Expectation: asserting alternative cases is done using chooseSplitCase() and  performSplit(case)
- Simplify to just pop() the trail 
***** Separate into: 
****** _context.pop()
****** chooseSplitCase()
****** performSplit()
**** 4a Add push calls for other cases (pop used to do this)
- Expectation: Backtracking mechanism works as intended. 
*** 2b Introduce BoundManager
**** write BoundManager class 
- Expectation: provides getter/setter interface for lower and upper bounds for every variable.
- Expectation: bounds are stored using context-dependent data-structures
- Expectation: backtracks correctly with the _context
**** 3c add BoundManager _boundManager memeber to the Engine 
- Expectation: single central object, visible to the SimplexEngine, bound tighteners, SmtCore 
**** 4b mirror all bound update calls to _boundManager  
- Expectation: _boundManager is in sync with bounds returned by the BoundTighteners 
***** Verify correctness at this point! 
**** 4c Tighteners obtain local bounds from BoundManager
- Expectation: all BoundTighteners use only _boundManager to store bounds 
***** Remove all updates to local bounds 
***** Remove local bounds 
**** 4d Tableau obtains local bounds from BoundManager
- Simplex ensures that bounds are up to date before performing any steps
**** 5c (optional) Refactor Tighteners   
***** 6a (optional) Create a Tightener interface/superclass
***** 7a (optional) Refactor existing tighteners
*** Refactor Tableau / Simplex
**** 1b Fix size of the tableau for ReLUs
- Use the existing forward/backward variables
- According to Guy the functionality should be there already
- Eliminates need for resizing, simplifies bookkeeping all-around
- Simplex-friendly encoding, by asserting constant bounds to the Tableau
**** Think about other PWLConstraints
*** 5a Remove existing store mechanism
- No longer necessary to store/restore states
**** Remove all calls to store/restore state
*** 5b Refactor precisionRestoration, to only restore the tableau 
- With bounds and ReLUs stored independently and incrementally there is no need to replay they ReLUs.
- Fixed size tableau -> eliminates need for replaying
*** EVALUATE PERFORMANCE

_work - a piece of computation, saves on memory re-alloc

Seems to serve as a high-level flow-control

** Solve()

** Questions/Issues 

*** Store the entire engine state, fairly often. 
**** Tableau, Bounds, etc.
*** Step away from exception driven control flow 
- this will affect almost everything
- when is the good time to do this?)
- Perhaps, implement new stuff without exceptions 
- Refactor old components over time? 
*** Separate into BoundTighteners, DecisionMakers, ...

Returns the list of case splits that this piecewise linear
constraint breaks into. These splits need to complementary,
i.e. if the list is {l1, l2, ..., ln-1, ln},
then ~l1 /\ ~l2 /\ ... /\ ~ln-1 --> ln.

Currently PWLConstraint returns a list of conjunctions, we could abstract that
to a list of n*k+1 clauses, where k is conjunction length.


f = y - ReLU(x) ::: (x > 0 /\ f = 0 ) \/ (x <= 0 /\ y = 0)

y = ReLU(x) ::: (x > 0 /\ x = y ) \/ (x <= 0 /\ y = 0)
(x > 0 \/ x <= 0) / in the lonf run getCases returns only this
(- (x > 0) \/ x = y) / monitored by boolean propagation
(- (x <= 0) \/ y = 0)
---------------------
( b1 \/ -b1)

Handled automatically
( b1 -> x = y)
( -b1 -> y = 0)
***** Separate current PWLConstraint into general Disjunction and things specific to Pwls
Introduce a general Disjunction class
Refactor PWLConstraint to be a subclass of Disjunction

**** BoundManager (base-level should be simple)
***** use context dependent data-structure to store bounds, test in parallel to existing data-structures
***** Centralized use, all Tighteners should use this to store bounds
****** Tightener refactor
******* Identify the interface, Implement it
******* Refactor existing tighteners using the interface

*** Refactor Push and Pop  
**** DecisionMaker (encapsulates different decision logic)
***** Class design  
***** Implement it
***** Refactor existing pieces
****** Internal ReLU Splitting (existing threshold guided branch and bound search)
****** Direct ReLU Splitting (potentially same as above) 
****** Input interval splitting (may also depend on Internal representation @1) 

*** Scheduler - Implement Search strategies: 
 Neurify-like, Reluplex-like, something in between?

** Engine (this list is unordered)
*** Precision restoration (to become very light-weight)
- Can this be associated somehow with the context?
- Replay the context instead of the current implementation
- When in the roadmap this makes sense to be done?
- By decoupling the tableau matrix from the matrix, there is no need to replay
  the SMT-level constraints on the simplex side.
- Is it neccessary to replay the constraints for bound tightening reasons?
- Most of the restorePrecision method seems to become redundant once bounds are
  decoupled from the tableau matrix.
*** Question: Difference between weak and strong restoration
*** applySplit
- INV: Only updates bounds, and does not touch the Tableau matrix
- revise: column merging functionality
*** Solve method 
- Refactor to put boiler-plate in the background
- Main loop with 
*** Eliminate Exception driven control flow
- InfeasibleQueryException -> Conflict, Conflict @0 is UNSAT
- 
*** CVC4s macros for logging things

Tableau integrates the tableau coefficients, bounds and assignment, and is stored frequently. 


If we introduce auxiliary ReLU variables upfront there is no reason to change
the tableau after the fact.

We only need to assert and backtrack bounds. Whatever simplex does to Tableau
state it is staying within the tableau, thus not needing to be stored.

Assignment does not need to be backtracked and thus no storing.


Simplex will need to make sure to fetch the latest bounds. Maybe use decision level for synchronization?

* Main loop  
- Step away from Exception-driven flow control
- Implements the global strategy of the algorithm 
  Neurify -> SmtCore and no simplex
  Marabou -> Simplex and occasional SMTCore split
- Elaborate on current functionality

*** Questions
**** Set a vision what it should be 
**** What's the relationship to SMTCore and other pieces. 

* SMT Core - a scheduler for different theory reasoning
SMTCore as the forum where all the different kinds of reasoning meet

** Adding Context object which will dictate backtracking using
advanceDecisionLevel and backtrack.

New implementation of performSplit and popSplit

Implementation of terms and literals

*** What is stored in the context.

*** How do we represent the information about, bounds/intervals, relus 

**** Representation as Booleans for ReLUs? Convenient for communication with a SAT solver
***** Do we keep a mapping? Or do we directly use the representation? 

** pwlConstraint refactor:
Disjunctions/Clause support 
PWLConstraint as a sub-class
IntervalPartition as a sub-class

>Allow disjunctions in queries (GREAT!)

** Decision-making pattern, with a simple interface
Splitting = decision making 
Implied splits = implication

ReLU splitting
Interval splitting
Disjunction splitting
Look into QueryDivider interface

Threshold for ReLU splitting - slowly phased out (over time), implemented in a
splitter.

*** Also, interface to a SAT solver 
Can have a decision making wrapper if we consult the SAT solver for decisions




** VISION: Learning and back-tracking - keep in mind  

** Questions
**** Set a vision what it should be 
*** What's the relationship to SMTCore and other pieces.
*** Currently: lacks flexibility for back-jumping 
** Changes
*** freeMemory goes away after context is introduced
*** TheorySolver interface from SMT: TheorySolver returns SAT/UNSAT/UNKNOWN  
*** reportViolatedConstraint -> ? reportAssignmentConflict/reportConflict
This method communicates a constraint has been violated. 
should move to a decisionMaking logic
*** getViolationCounts 
should move to a decisionMaking logic
**** setConstraintViolationThreshold
**** chooseViolatedConstraintForFixing
**** pickSplitPLConstraint
**** Engine:pickSplitPLConstraint
*** _needToSplit - might become more complex, who wants to split, how?
**** Might become an enum
*** performSplit
Assumes it know what to split on
**** Separate ReLU Splitting logic from general splitting logic
**** No negations -> ReLU Splitting and Disjunction splitting.
**** Store alternativeSplits? Do we need this, there are other solutions
***** Alternative: Store flags for cases in the constraint itself?
**** PWLConstraint getConstraints  ?
**** popSplit - needs severe refactoring
***** Just the pop()
***** Separate decide of alternative splits 
***** What does checkSkewFromDebuggingSolution() does?
**** recordImpliedValidSplit -> Implications, could be more than just ReLUs in the future.
**** allSplitsSoFar -> getAllReLUPhases

* Simplex Core
For now, we try to minimize the changes to the simplex code. Proposed changes
should merely move the main copy of the bounds to BoundManager. A simple method
that updates the tableau bounds should be implemented. 

#+begin_src C++ 
  // Copies new Bounds from the bound manager. 
  //Lazy options include using the ContextNotifyObj to store the exact bounds that
  // need updating.
  Tableau::updateBounds()
  {
  }
#+end_src
This method is called before any simplex steps are taken.
The Tableau should be unchanged otherwise.

** How would restorPrecision work?
* Bounds

** Observations
Separate copy of the bounds is kept at:
- ConstraintBoundTightener
- RowBoundTightener
- SymbolicBoundTightener

- Simplex - either update bound from the BM, or uses ContextNotifyObj interface,
  consider tighter itegration in second iteration.

First wave - implementation can just mimic the call to local copies of lower and upper bounds.

Second wave - Refactor the bound tighteners to use the BoundManager in the same
way. Goal: identify bound tightener pattern. A function to enumerate terms and a
function to propagate bounds on them.


We propose a bound manager class:
#+begin_src C++ 
BoundManager::BoundManager(const Context & ctx)
: _ctx(ctx)
, _lowerBounds(NULL) // vector of vectors of pairs (decisionLevel, bound)
, _upperBounds(NULL) // vector of vectors of pairs (decisionLevel, bound)
{}

/* Getters*/
BoundManager::getLowerBound(Variable x)
BoundManager::getUpperBound(Variable x)
/* Setters */
BoundManager::setLowerBound(Variable x, Double value)
BoundManager::setUpperBound(Variable x, Double value)
#+end_src


Storing bounds in only one place. Different tighteners are just different strategies of same type of reasoning.


Bound manager will by design be back-trackable, and further more easy to build upon for explanation generation.


Two versions: One stores all bound inferences (might be desireable for explainability), the other stores only tightest bound inference at every level.
